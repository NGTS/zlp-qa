# Binned lightcurves by brightness

The top three panels with blue points show metadata for the observation.

The bottom panels with red points show the median behaviour (where fluxes are normalised and combined per image, as [this description](/help/rms-vs-time.html)) where stars are first grouped into logarithmically spaced flux groups before normalisation. This shows the bulk behaviour of the bright stars vs faint stars.

Fluxes are in ADU per second.

Typically the final two panels include saturated stars and hence have atypical behaviour.
