# Extracted astrometric parameters

The top two panels show the RA and DEC:

* the commanded ra and dec of the mount (blue), does not change throughout the night
* the position the telescope thinks it is (purple) which is constantly being moved by the autoguider correcting for the lack of pointing model
* the astrometrically solved centre of the frame (red)

The third panel shows the sky level, with error bars representing the sky noise. These are bulk parameters of the frame as measured by the photometry software.

The last two parameters show two more parameters computed by the astrometric software, related to the number of sources used to crossmatch to the external 2MASS catalogue for astrometric solving, and the rms of the astrometric offsets.
