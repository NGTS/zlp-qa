# Astrometry rms

A series of vector diagrams equally spaced throughout the observation, showing the position of each source in our image and the position from an external catalogue. The red dot marks the centre of distortion for the image. The title shows the median rms. Typically we want this value to be ~0.5" = 0.1 pixels. Each vector has been magnified by 1 million.

Any error in the radial distortion terms will show up as ring-like features.

This plot occasionally looks worse than the RMS indicates. This is where a few mismatches dominate the look of the plot. Look carefully and see if there are well-matched points amongst the mess.
