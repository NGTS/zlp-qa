#Â RMS with binning

This plot shows the noise quality of groups of lightcurves as exposures are combined.

A bulk lightcurve is computed for each brightness group (indicated by the colour scale), and binned with increasing bin size.

The ideal white noise behaviour is indicated by the dashed black lines for each group. Any red noise will present as a horizontal feature.
