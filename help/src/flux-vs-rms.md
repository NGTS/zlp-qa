# Flux vs RMS

*The fractional noise level in each unbinned lightcurve as a function of star brightness*

Each star is represented as a point. The x axis is an approximate magnitude, and the y axis is the rms of the mean-subtracted magnitude.

Some key points: if everything is well behaved, the bright stars will be limited by extinction at around 1-10% depending on how much airmass range the observations cover. The faint stars are limited by photon noise in the sky background and have a characeristic slope.

Without extinction the bright stars are either limited by scintillation at the level of a few mmag, or red noise.

Only a small region of parameter space is limited by source brightness, between the scintillation limited and sky limited regions.

For example an approximate noise model projected for the instrument and 30 second exposures. The scintillation level is uncertain.
